  { q: "What interests you about this role?", good: "Name something specific about the company or the role, not \"I am looking for growth.\" Generic here reads as mass-applying, and I move on." },
  { q: "What are your salary expectations?", good: "This is the real reason for the call. Give a researched range, not a number, and make it a range you would actually accept. More on this below." },
  { q: "Are you interviewing anywhere else?", good: "A light yes is good. It signals you are in demand. \"I have a couple of processes going\" is plenty. Do not name companies or oversell." },

A wild number ends the call." },

Best move?", a: [["Keep it neutral and forward looking", "right"], ["Explain in detail how bad your boss is", "wrong"], ["Say you are being underpaid and disrespected", "wrong"], ["Say you are bored", "wrong"]], e: "Anything negative about a current employer makes me wonder what you will say about us. Neutral and forward looking, every time." },
  { q: "The screen is scheduled for 15 minutes. You should plan to talk for about?", a: [["Half the time, and listen the other half", "right"], ["The whole 15 minutes, show enthusiasm", "wrong"], ["As little as possible", "wrong"], ["However long they let you", "wrong"]], e: "A screen is a conversation, not a monologue. If you talk the whole time, I learn you cannot read a room. Answer, then let me lead." },

Best response?", a: [["Say so plainly and say how fast you learn", "right"], ["Make something up and hope", "wrong"], ["Go silent", "wrong"], ["Change the subject", "wrong"]], e: "A bluff falls apart on the follow up. \"I have not done that, here is how quickly I picked up the last new thing\" beats a fake answer every time." },

What is the single best thing to do?", a: [["Ask what the next step and timeline are", "right"], ["Just say thanks and hang up", "wrong"], ["Ask if you got the job", "wrong"], ["Immediately start negotiating", "wrong"]], e: "Asking about next steps shows you are serious and gives you a date to follow up on. It is the easiest point you can score." },

Verify it before you apply." },
  { q: "You said you worked somewhere March 2021, they have you starting in May 2021. Big deal?", v: "flag", e: "Date gaps of a month or two get flagged by automated checks even when harmless. Use the exact dates from your pay stubs or offer letters, not your memory." },
  { q: "You listed a degree you are six credits short of finishing. Safe to leave as-is?", v: "flag", e: "This is the one that actually ends offers. Never list a degree you did not complete. Say \"coursework toward\" or list it honestly. A pulled offer over this is common and completely avoidable." },
  { q: "A reference is a coworker who liked you, not your manager. Acceptable?", v: "clear", e: "Usually fine, especially if a manager is hard to reach. A peer who can speak to your actual work beats a manager who barely remembers you. Just brief them first." },
  { q: "You have a job now and do not want your current boss called. Can you control that?", v: "clear", e: "Yes, and it is normal. \"Please do not contact my current employer until we have an offer\" is a standard, reasonable request that no good recruiter will hold against you." },
  { q: "You got let go from a job two years ago. Will a background check reveal why?", v: "clear", e: "Background checks confirm dates and title, not the reason you left. That story is yours to frame in the interview. The check itself will not out you." },

    weak: "Well, I was born in Ohio, went to school for marketing, then I worked retail for a while, then I did some customer service, and now I am here looking for something new.",
    strong: "I have spent six years in hospitality, most recently managing a team of 18. The part I have always done best is the people side: hiring, training, and keeping everyone steady when it gets busy. I have been building toward HR intentionally, and a coordinator role is exactly where I want to put that experience to work.",
    note: "Two minutes maximum. Do not start at birth. Start with what you do now, connect it to this role, and stop talking." },
  { id: "q2", cat: "The pivot", q: "Why are you making this transition into HR?",
    why: "I want to know this is a real decision and not a random escape from a job you dislike. I am also checking whether you will leave in six months.",
    ev: "Intentionality and whether you understand what the job actually involves.",
    weak: "I am kind of burnt out where I am and HR seems like a good next step. I have always been a people person.",
    strong: "The work I have always done best involves people: communicating, coordinating, and solving problems in real time. I have been moving toward HR on purpose. I have been reading up on employment basics and talking to people in the field, and this role is the right next step. I am not leaving my background behind, I am bringing all of it with me.",
    note: "Do not apologize for your background and do not over explain it. Connect the dots and let your confidence do the rest." },

    weak: "I had a really difficult customer once but I stayed calm and handled it professionally and it worked out fine.",
    strong: "A customer was furious that their order was wrong for the second time. I let them finish, repeated back what went wrong so they knew I heard it, told them exactly what I could do and by when, and then followed up the next day to confirm it landed. They came back and asked for me by name after that.",

    weak: "I cannot really think of a big one. I am pretty detail oriented so I do not make many mistakes.",
    strong: "I entered the wrong information on a schedule and it threw off two shifts. As soon as I caught it I owned it, fixed it, and told the people it affected so it would not cause more problems downstream. Then I started double checking that step, and I made a template so the rest of the team would not hit the same thing.",

    strong: "I use our scheduling and POS system daily for reporting and records, and I picked it up fast when I started. I have not worked in Workday or Greenhouse directly. I have been reading about how applicant tracking systems work, and based on how quickly I learned our current system I am confident I would be up to speed within a couple of weeks.",
    note: "Only claim what you have actually used. If I ask a follow up and it falls apart, that is a dealbreaker, and it is a much bigger problem than not having the system. Honesty plus \"I learn fast\" beats a fake answer every time." },

    ev: "Confidence, clarity, and whether you actually want this specific job.",
    weak: "I feel like I would be a really good fit and I am a hard worker and a fast learner, so I think I would do well here.",
    strong: "Because I already do a version of this work and I do it well. I keep a lot moving at once, I handle people when they are frustrated, and I follow through. I am reliable and I ramp fast. I would come in and help the team without needing a lot of hand holding.",
    note: "Then ask what the next step is. Tell them straight up that you want the job. It is astonishing how few people do, and it genuinely moves the needle." },

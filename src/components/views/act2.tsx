      <div className="card">
        <h3 className="sec">How your resume actually gets read</h3>
        <p className="body"><strong>Ten seconds on the first pass.</strong> That is genuinely all the time a lot of us spend. In those ten seconds I am checking three things: can I find your most recent title fast, do your bullets have numbers, and do your dates make sense.</p>
        <p className="body">If I have to work to figure out what you did, I move on. It is not personal. I have 200 applications and a role that was supposed to be filled last week.</p>
        <p className="body">The other thing worth knowing: <strong>most applications get filtered by software before I ever see them.</strong> That is why the keywords from the posting need to actually appear in your resume, and why tables and graphics are a genuine problem. When a parser hits a table, your information comes out scrambled.</p>
        <Note kind="decode" label="What hiring managers really mean"><p>When a hiring manager says they want someone who can &quot;hit the ground running,&quot; they are telling you they do not have time to train. Your job in the interview is to make them believe you will not need much hand holding. Say it directly: &quot;I would come in and help the team without needing a lot of hand holding.&quot;</p></Note>

Job growth has slowed, layoffs have been working through the system, and companies are trimming headcount while they pour money into other priorities. That means fewer open seats and more competition for each one.</p>
        <p className="body">I am not telling you this to discourage you. I am telling you because <strong>the strategy that worked in a hot market does not work now,</strong> and if nobody tells you that, you will assume the problem is you.</p>
        <Note kind="myth" label="Myth versus reality">
          <p><strong>Myth:</strong> apply to everything, qualified or not. Confidence is what matters.</p>
          <p><strong>Reality:</strong> that is a recipe for burnout. Every application costs energy. If you spray resumes at roles you are not remotely a fit for, you spend that energy collecting rejection instead of on the moves that actually work: customizing for roles you genuinely fit, networking with the recruiter tied to that role, and following up after you apply.</p>

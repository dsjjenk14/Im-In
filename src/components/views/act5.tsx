        <h1>Getting hired was the easy part.</h1>
        <p>Nobody tells you this, so I will. The first year in a new field is where you either root in and grow, or quietly start to struggle around month seven. Let us make sure it is the first one.</p>
      </div>

      <Bridge why={<>You made it through 90 days. But a career change is not finished at day 90, it is finished around month twelve, when you either belong here or you are quietly wondering if you made a mistake. <strong>This is the part almost no career guide covers,</strong> and it is where a lot of pivots quietly fall apart. So here is what I wish someone had told me.</>}

        <h3 className="sec">The month-seven wall</h3>
        <Squiggle />
        <p className="body">Here is the pattern I have watched over and over. The first three months are exciting. Everyone is patient, everything is new, you are proving yourself. Then around month six or seven, <strong>the honeymoon ends.</strong> You are expected to just know things now. The patience thins. And nobody announces this shift, you just feel it.</p>
        <p className="body">This is not a sign you failed. It is the exact moment the job becomes real, and it happens to everyone, in every field. The people who make it through are the ones who saw it coming and did not take it personally. <strong>Now you have seen it coming.</strong></p>
        <Note kind="story" label="My story"><p>When I built that recruiting function from nothing, month seven was brutal. The novelty was gone and the expectations were real, and I genuinely wondered if I was in over my head. I was not. I just hit the wall everyone hits. I kept showing up, kept tracking what I fixed, and a year later I was training the people we hired next.</p></Note>

      <div className="card">
        <h3 className="sec">Managing up, without the jargon</h3>
        <p className="body">Managing up just means making your manager&apos;s job easier and making sure they know what you are doing. It is not politics and it is not sucking up. It is the single highest-return habit in your first year.</p>
        <Tpl label="The weekly update your manager will love" text={"Quick end-of-week note:\n\n1. Done this week: [2 or 3 things, with a number where you can]\n2. In progress: [what is moving]\n3. Need from you: [one clear ask, or \"nothing this week\"]\n\nHave a good weekend."} />

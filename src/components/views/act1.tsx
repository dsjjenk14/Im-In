        <p className="body">What I did not understand at the time is that I was learning to build trust with a stranger in under ninety seconds, stay steady when someone was upset with me, and hit a number every day without anyone standing over me. <strong>That is the recruiting job.</strong> I just did not have the words for it yet.</p>

I did not get it by applying. <strong>I knew someone who owned a staffing firm.</strong> They won a contract, and that is how I got in the door.

Second, and this is the part that matters for you: <strong>this is how a huge number of jobs actually get filled,</strong> and it is a door you can build for yourself starting today. It is not luck. It is being known by enough people that your name comes up in a room you are not standing in.</p>
        <Rec><p>Here is the uncomfortable math. A posted role gets hundreds of applicants and you are a resume in a pile. A referred candidate gets read every time. Same person, same resume, completely different odds. That gap is not fair, but you can use it starting this week.</p></Rec>

        <Squiggle />
        <p className="body">In that first coordinator role, I made a point of networking with the HR team. Not strategically, at first. I just talked to people.</p>
        <p className="body">That is how I met the recruiters, and honestly, I was fascinated by them. <strong>They were always on the go. Always talking to somebody.</strong> The pace was fast and it was competitive, and the more I watched, the more I thought: that is the part of this building I want to be in.</p>
        <p className="body">Nobody told me to figure it out that way. I just paid attention to which people seemed to be doing work I actually envied. That is a genuinely good way to choose a career, and it beats reading a job description and guessing.</p>
        <Band icon="bulb" color="#8EDBC2"><b>You can do this before you commit.</b> Find someone doing the job you think you want and get twenty minutes with them. Ask what their Tuesday looks like.

        <h3 className="sec">First, the split</h3>
        <p className="body">When people say they want to get into HR, they almost always mean one of two very different careers. Both live under the same umbrella, both hire people from non traditional backgrounds, and early on they even overlap. But the day to day work, the personality each one rewards, and where they eventually take you are not the same.</p>
        <p className="body"><strong>Recruiting is the front door of the company.</strong> You find people, sell them on the role, guide them through the process, and close the offer. It is fast, it is target driven, and it has a scoreboard.</p>
        <p className="body"><strong>The generalist side is everything that happens after someone is already an employee.</strong> Onboarding, benefits, employee relations, performance, policy, and the messy human situations nobody puts in a job description. It is broader, steadier, and far more judgment heavy.</p>

        <Rec><p>You do not have to choose forever. Coordinator roles touch both sides, which is exactly why they are such a smart first job. Plenty of people start in recruiting, find they love the human side, and cross over. I have watched it go both ways more than once.</p></Rec>

      <div className="card">
        <h3 className="sec">The four doors in</h3>
        <p className="sub">Entry level roles are stepping stones, not destinations. The point of the first one is exposure.</p>
        <p className="body">Most people trying to break in aim too high too fast. They chase recruiter roles before they have any context, or generalist roles before they have any credibility. The smarter move is to start somewhere that will genuinely teach you, then climb from real knowledge instead of borrowed confidence.</p>
        <div className="grid2">
          <Door n={1} title="HR Assistant">You see how the engine runs. Onboarding, HRIS data, compliance paperwork, employee records. The strongest operational foundation, especially for the generalist path.</Door>
          <Door n={2} title="Recruiting Coordinator">Interview scheduling, ATS management, candidate communication. The fastest exposure to how hiring actually works, from day one.</Door>
          <Door n={3} title="HR Coordinator">A blend of both. Benefits, employee relations, and recruiting support at once. The most well rounded first job if you have not picked a side.</Door>
          <Door n={4} title="Agency Recruiter">Fast and performance driven. The single most open door in the industry, and the one I walked through myself.</Door>
        </div>
        <Note kind="decode" label="What hiring managers really mean"><p>The title matters far less than what the role will teach you. Read the posting and ask one question: will this put me near the hiring process, near candidates, or near HR systems? If yes, it is worth your time even if the title sounds junior.</p></Note>
      </div>

      <div className="card">
        <h3 className="sec">Why agency work is the fastest launchpad</h3>
        <p className="body">Agency environments are high volume and performance driven. You will learn to source candidates, manage pipelines, and hold your own with hiring managers. You will also learn to handle rejection, stay organized under pressure, and close. Those skills follow you everywhere afterward.</p>
        <p className="body">A lot of the strongest corporate recruiters put in time at an agency early, precisely because nothing builds the fundamentals faster. You are placing real people in real roles and answering to real numbers. <strong>In a year at an agency you will work more roles than many corporate recruiters see in three.</strong></p>
        <Note kind="mistake" label="The honest trade off"><p>Agency life is demanding and not everyone thrives in it. The pressure is real, the hours run long, and the income can be variable if commission is involved. But even one or two years of it on your resume opens corporate doors for the rest of your career. Go in with your eyes open, not with a fantasy.</p></Note>
